Q: Looking at the backtrace output, which function called syscall?
A: usertrap() at kernel/trap.c:67 called syscall()

Q: What is the value of p->trapframe->a7 and what does that value represent? (Hint: look user/initcode.S, the first user program xv6 starts.)
A: p->trapframe->a7, value = 0x7, represents invoking the following ecall to execute syscall of *exec*

Q: What was the previous mode that the CPU was in?
A: SPP = 0 -> CPU was previously in user mode.

Q: Write down the assembly instruction the kernel is panicing at. Which register corresponds to the variable num?
A: kernel is panicing at lw	a3,0(zero). a3 corresponds to variable num.

Q: Why does the kernel crash? Hint: look at figure 3-3 in the text; is address 0 mapped in the kernel address space? Is that confirmed by the value in scause above? (See description of scause in RISC-V privileged instructions)
A: The code tries to load a unmapped memory address. scause=0xd, means Load page fault.

Q: What is the name of the process that was running when the kernel paniced? What is its process id (pid)?
A: The name is initcode\000\000\000\000\000\000\000. The pid = 1.
