    │ c i o u │
    │ d j p v │
    │ e k q w │
    └ f l r x ┘.
    These columns are treated as independent by the model, which means that the
    dependence of e. g. 'g' on 'f' cannot be learned, but allows more efficient
    batch processing.
    If the data cannot be evenly divided by the batch size, trim off the remainder.

    ┌ a g m s ┐ ┌ b h n t ┐

    Note that despite the name of the function, the subdivison of data is not
    done along the batch dimension (i.e. dimension 1), since that was handled
    by the batchify function. The chunks are along dimension 0, corresponding
    to the seq_len dimension in the LSTM or RNN.
